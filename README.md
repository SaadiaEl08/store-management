# Store Management

This website is a simple store management system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed for educational purposes to help you practice CRUDS operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete,Search). The project uses local storage to simulate a database.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete products
- Store data using local storage
- Basic styling with CSS for a clean interface

## Inspiration

I got the idea for this project from a YouTube channel called Abdelrahman Gamal.
